                <p class="lead drop-cap"> With more than 905 companies and more than 19,000 employees, France has become the world leader in tailoring, with a turnover of €2 billion. Between nuts, screws, pistons, a large part of the daily parts comes from these large factories. Hydraulic pistons present in the large excavator for work in buildings at the simple axis of wheels of bicycles for Sunday walks, These parts only come from the cutting and form the everyday objects of all workers in mechanical environments. A question arises. Where do these parts come from and how are they manufactured? After an internship in a factory located in Cluses, the main city grouping mills, I will tell you the secrets of these companies<p>

                <h3> Origines</h3>
                <p>Born in the 18th century in the watchmaking industry, bar turning has never stopped evolving. It was in 1720 that a craftsman moved to a village in Haute-Savoie and set up a workshop next to his stable to make timepieces during the summers. It is at the end of this century that bar turning will decentralize its specialization and will begin to open up to various branches of multiple fields. The industrial revolution in the 19th century marks the first major turning point. It will be quickly followed by an expansion of the bar turning industry, in particular following the requisition of companies to participate in the armament effort during the First World War. Subsequently, the need for parts for the automotive markets continued to increase and allowed the proliferation of factories, particularly in the Arve and Giffre valleys in Haute-Savoie. First semi-automatic, then automatic and increasingly digital thanks to computer development, the machines used in these industries have evolved over time. Their key objectives are the best possible yield from three parent values: High precision, high production and reduction of manufacturing costs. This modernization assures customers of quality parts that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. <! - <p> Behind these foods, the "sandwich artists", the honorary title given to restaurant staff. </p> 
                <h3>My place within MachedaFrères</h3>
                
                <p>During my week of internship in the third class, I joined the Macheda Frères bar turning factory, located in Cluses, in the Arve valley. Not having the skills or the diplomas to be able to build a machine or ensure the production of parts, my role in the company was relatively small but not uninteresting! After two days of briefing and explanations on the profession of bar turning with Mr. Macheda Carmelo, owner of the factory, I had the right to a course on the production of his lathes. It all starts with a customer call. The customer sends a part plan to the bar turning machine which he will analyze later in order to offer the customer a price and a design duration. Depending on the material and the quantity of parts requested, the price varies! If the price offered by the bar turning machine is accepted by the customer, then the order is launched. From ordering to shipping the parts, the work of the bar turning machine can be broken down into several parts: first, the machine used to design the part is assembled, that is to say, the tools necessary for the production of the part are set up on the automatic machine. After various adjustments and checks, production can begin. During production, automatic machines do not require the replenishment of metal bars which will be cut into the shape of the part ordered. This action was one of my main tasks to perform during my internship, because it only required simple explanations and the realization was not very complicated. The parts then fall into large rolling containers which will then be wrung out in order to remove the excess oils left on the parts. One of my second duties was to put the parts out of the spinning into metal crates to be sent for processing, this step is crucial, it prevents the parts from rusting over time. After processing, I had to put the parts in the boxes, label them and then place them on a pallet to ship them to customers. Often between each step, a coffee break was necessary, an opportunity for the boss to tell me a little more about the production in progress! This is the story of these pieces which, once assembled, form our everyday objects.
                <p> If you liked the creation of the pieces, I will then tell you about the history of the Macheda Frères factory </p>
                
                <h3> MachedaFrères Factory</h3>
                

                <p>Originally from Italy, Mr. Carmélo Macheda successfully completed (promotion major) studies in the field of geometric design. After obtaining this diploma, he will do an internship in Switzerland in a company manufacturing machine tools and will obtain, after various promotions, the title and skills of foreman. It was after six years of work as a foreman that he decided to join his brother Joseph, who graduated as a bar turning machine from the Cluses watchmaking school (ENH) and who held the bar turning diploma. On February 1, 1971, the alliance of the two brothers led to the creation of the Macheda Frères factory, symbolizing their union. After a difficult start related to the price of the machines they needed for the business and the funds they had, the family business will grow with a final staff of 12 effective employees as well as various temporary workers. The fields of production are varied, ranging from automobiles to watchmaking, including industrial machines or the manufacture of hydraulic parts. Currently, Macheda Frères is still an active factory, but does not have as only worker, its owner, who does not give up his passion for his profession and this, despite his past 80th birthday.

                            <p>This third year internship was an opportunity for me to discover the world of industry in one of the areas cradling my childhood. From a young age, my grandfather, Carmélo Macheda, has been telling me about his factory and his profession with the story behind it. It was when I was 14 that I had the opportunity to push open the doors of this family business to discover in detail all its secrets. This most interesting internship will later become the first job I wanted to do. My passion for IT will make me follow a different path but has never prevented me from returning to work alongside my grandfather and tirelessly listening to the stories and origins of his pride in his company. </p>
